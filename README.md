# Do Shou Qi
I made my daughter a Do Shou Qi ("Animal Chess") set for Christmas 2023. This
was done by drawing the board and animals in Postscript, printing them onto
sticker paper, coloring them, and then sticking the stickers onto wooden
pieces.

## How To Play
1.  Each player has eight numbered animals: a *rat* (1), a *cat* (2), a *dog*
    (3), a *wolf* (4), a *leopard* (5), a *tiger* (6), a *lion* (7), and an
    *elephant* (8). These animals start the game on the same-numbered square
    on that player's side of the board.

2.  Players take turns moving an animal. Animals can move one square forward,
    backward, left, or right, but not diagonally. However, you cannot move an
    animal to repeat a prior state of the game.

3.  The square marked with a crown is a *den*. Your animals cannot
    move onto your own den, but you win if one of your animals moves onto your
    opponent's den.

4.  Your animals cannot move onto the same square as another of your animals,
    or onto an opponent's animal with a larger number; but if one of your
    animals moves onto an opponent's animal with the same or a smaller number,
    it is *captured* and removed from the game. As an exception, rats (1) can
    capture elephants (8) instead of the reverse: this is because elephants are
    afraid of rats!

5.  The squares marked with Ã—'s are *traps*. A trapped animal may be captured
    by any kind of animal as if its number were zero. (A trapped rat (1) may
    even be captured by an elephant (8).)

6.  The blue squares in the middle of the board are *rivers*. Animals cannot
    move onto a river. As an exception, rats (1) are very good swimmers and can
    move on rivers, but cannot capture when moving onto or off of a river.

7.  Tigers (6) and lions (7) are very strong and can jump in a straight
    line over a river in a single move: tigers (6) can jump horizontally over
    two river squares, and lions (7) can jump in either direction over up to
    three river squares. These animals can even capture another animal when
    jumping; however, they are too afraid of the water to jump over a swimming
    animal.

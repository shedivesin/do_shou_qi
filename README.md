# Do Shou Qi
I made my daughter a Do Shou Qi ("Animal Chess") set for Christmas 2023. This
was done by drawing the board and animals in Postscript, printing them onto
sticker paper, coloring them, and then sticking the stickers onto wooden
pieces.

## How To Play
1.  Each player has eight numbered pieces: a mouse (1), a cat (2), a dog (3), a
    wolf (4), a leopard (5), a tiger (6), a lion (7), and an elephant (8). At
    the beginning of the game, each piece sits on the appropriately-numbered
    square on each player's side of the board.

2.  Players alternate turns. A turn consists of moving a piece one square up,
    down, left, or right. Diagonal moves are not allowed.

3.  If a piece moves onto an opponent's piece of a lesser or equal number, the
    opponent's piece is captured and removed from play for the remainder of the
    game. It is not allowed to move onto one's own piece or onto an opponent's
    piece of a greater number.

4.  As an exception to rule 3, the mouse can capture the elephant, and the
    elephant cannot capture the mouse. This is because elephants are afraid of
    mice!

5.  The blue squares in the center of the board are rivers. Cats (2, 5, 6, 7)
    hate water and cannot move into those squares. The river is too deep and
    swift for an elephant (8) to swim in, so it cannot move into those squares,
    either. Mice (1) and canines (3, 4) can swim and so can move into the river
    squares: however, since they are busy swimming, they cannot capture other
    pieces when moving into or out of a water square.

6.  The squares marked with X's are traps. Any piece on a trap square can be
    captured by any other piece as if it's number was zero. (A trapped mouse
    may even be captured by an elephant.)

7.  The square marked with a crown is a den. Your pieces are not allowed to
    move into your own den, and you win the game if you move any piece into
    your opponent's den.

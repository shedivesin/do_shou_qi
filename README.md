# Do Shou Qi
I made my daughter a Do Shou Qi ("Animal Chess") set for Christmas 2023. This
was done by drawing the board and animals in Postscript, printing them onto
sticker paper, coloring them, and then sticking the stickers onto wooden
pieces.

## How To Play
1.  Each player has eight numbered pieces: a mouse (1), a cat (2), a dog (3), a
    wolf (4), a leopard (5), a tiger (6), a lion (7), and an elephant (8). At
    the beginning of the game, each piece sits on the appropriately-numbered
    square on each player's side of the board.

2.  Players alternate turns. A turn consists of moving a piece one square up,
    down, left, or right. Diagonal moves are not allowed.

3.  If a piece moves onto an opponent's piece of a lesser or equal number, the
    opponent's piece is captured and removed from play for the remainder of the
    game. It is not allowed to move onto one's own piece or onto an opponent's
    piece of a greater number.

    As an exception, the mouse can capture the elephant and the elephant
    cannot capture the mouse. This is because elephants are afraid of mice!

4.  The blue squares in the center of the board are rivers. Cats (2, 5, 6, 7)
    hate water and the river is too deep and swift for an elephant (8), and so
    they cannot move into those squares. Mice (1) and canines (3, 4) are strong
    swimmers and so can move into the river squares: however, since they are
    busy swimming, they cannot capture other pieces when moving into or out of
    a water square.

5.  The tiger (6) and lion (7) are very strong and are able to leap over a
    river: the tiger can leap horizontally (e.g. over two squares) and the lion
    can leap in either direction (e.g. over two squares or three squares).
    However, as they are frightened of the water, they cannot leap over a
    swimming animal.

6.  The squares marked with X's are traps. Any piece on a trap square can be
    captured by any other piece as if it's number was zero. (A trapped mouse
    may even be captured by an elephant.)

7.  The square marked with a crown is a den. Your pieces are not allowed to
    move into your own den, and you win the game if you move any piece into
    your opponent's den.
